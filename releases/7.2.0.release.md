# [Updated Postman Collection v7.2.0](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/389172/2s935vnLvt)

## Additions
* Added `nearby` property in [Reversegeo API](https://pegasus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/reverse-geocoding).
   * GET method (https://api.pegasusgateway.com/reversegeo?lat=25.9865&lon=-80.11959&zones=true&nearby=5000)
   * POST method (https://api.pegasusgateway.com/reversegeo?zones=true&nearby=5000)
* Added `Nearest POI` in Alerts UI. The Alert modal shows the Points of Interest nearby (<= 30000m) from the vehicle's location.
* Added `Point of Interest` checkbox in Create/Edit Geofence UI.
* Added 'report-counters' section in [Counters docs](https://pegasus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/counters#report-counters). This section explains how to obtain the counters for the reports.
* Added a virtual event when an enhanced asset is no longer assigned to a vehicle.
* Added raters to the /apps resource, global: 20 requests/second, per user: 5requests/second, 20requests/minute (https://pegasus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/api-overview#rates)
* Concox added safe engine immobilization command for model jm-vl103.
* Added new parameters to the rawdata api `entities` & `assets`[Rawdata API](https://pegasus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/rawdata)
* Added new rawdata field: `modem_temperature`.
* Added a new filter for trigger message templates called: toDate.
    Example:
    {{some_epoch | toDate:"America/New_York"}} # converts the epoch to a timestamp in America/New_York timezone and uses ISOFORMAT for the date format.
    {{some_epoch | toDate:"America/New_York,YY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss"}} # converts the epoch to a timestamp in America/New_York timezone and uses a custom date format.

## Fixes
* Entity unlinking was fixed (https://pegasus.digitalcomtech.com/reference/unlinkentity).
* Entity replication for enhanced assets that are assigned to syrus 4 devices.
* Subject and email body for alerts with geofence information.
* Fixed the order in which incoming alerts are displayed.
* Fixed, handling of empty ;TS tags (modem temperature from Syrus 4 devices)
* Vehicle associations order was fixed, it now shows the most recent 5.


## Changes
* The fields `speed`, `mph`, and `ecu_speed` now accept decimals [Rawdata API](https://pegasus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/master-fields-list).
* JSON Forwarder supports a new flag for sending speed data as float `__ecu_speed_float` the default is that this flag is not set, so speed values are sent as integers. But within 3 months we’ll make this a requirement so that all json forwarders need to support floats in the speed values for mph, speed and ecu_speed.
* The [JSON Receiver](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u3-91odmcupsetTl-57Mp-mmBwQI6f0LPzxEWBG4dbQ/edit?usp=sharing) now accepts fuel consumed as decimals (`can.fuel.consumed`)
* Tracking columns order on Trips Report.
* Column name `can.j1939.vehicle.speed` in Atrack engine speed, was changed to `ecu_speed`.
* Scope: entities.link allows forced linking between two entities.


## Improvements
* [Counter API](https://pegasus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/counters#report-counters) Improvement in the function that return the total fuel consumed `ecu_tfuel`.
* [Alerts API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/389172/2s935vnLvt#0e29290b-0109-40b3-8a37-153c69997078) The alerts search now loads more results.
