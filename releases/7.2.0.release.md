# 7.2.0 - Release Notes
* Original release: 2023 SEP 26*


## Additions
* Added `nearby` property in [Reversegeo API](https://pegasus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/reverse-geocoding).
   * GET method (https://api.pegasusgateway.com/reversegeo?lat=25.9865&lon=-80.11959&zones=true&nearby=5000)
   * POST method (https://api.pegasusgateway.com/reversegeo?zones=true&nearby=5000)
* Added `Nearest POI` in Alerts UI. The Alert modal shows the Points of Interest nearby (<= 30000m) from the vehicle's location.
* Added `Point of Interest` checkbox in Create/Edit Geofence UI.
* Added 'report-counters' session in (https://pegasus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/counters#report-counters). This session explains how to obtain the counters for the reports.


## Fixes
* Entity unlinking was fixed (https://pegasus.digitalcomtech.com/reference/unlinkentity). 


## Changes
* The fields `speed`,`mph` and `ecu_speed` now accept decimals [Rawdata API](https://pegasus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/master-fields-list).
* JSON Forwarder supports a new flag for sending speed data as float `__ecu_speed_float` the default is that this flag is not set, so speed values are sent as integers. But within 3 months weâ€™ll make this a requirement so that all json forwarders need to support floats in the speed values for mph,speed or ecu_speed.
* The JSON Receiver (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u3-91odmcupsetTl-57Mp-mmBwQI6f0LPzxEWBG4dbQ/edit?usp=sharing) now accepts fuel consumed as decimals (`can.fuel.consumed`)
