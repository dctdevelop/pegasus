# 6.6.1 - Release Notes
*Original release: June 01 - 2021*
*Latest: July 21 - 2021*

### Live Communications

There's an important change for any developer that's using live communications via the websockets and that is that polling is disabled on the server, so you must use **websocket** as a transport to succesfully connect.

```js
// Initialize the socket
// you must use websocket as the transport, polling (default) is disabled
var socket = io('https://aws-live-0.pegasusgateway.com/socket', {transports: ['websocket']})
```

- Added support for [ev_labels](https://docs.pegasusgateway.com/#evlabels) transformations on the managed configurations

> PUT [`api/configurations/:ky`](https://pegasus1.pegasusgateway.com/api/configurations/r021)

```json
{
	"ev_labels": {
		"in1on": "dooropn",
        "in2on": "buzzeron",
        "spd": "excess"
    }
}
```

- The taip tag ;ZC now fills the ecu_error fields, for compatibility with SyrusJS


##### Improved

- Improved email translations for large attachments

- Improved the json parsers speed field mapping

##### Fixed

- Fixed a bug with the reception of labels for Syrus 4 & Third Party Devices

##### Deprecation

The following ECU fields from previous releases were deprecated:

* `ecu_ev_rpm` MERGED WITH **`ecu_rpm`**
* `ecu_ev_odometer` MERGED WITH **`ecu_distance`**
* `ecu_ev_speed_2` MERGED WITH **`ecu_speed`**
* `ecu_ev_vehicle_speed` MERGED WITH **`ecu_speed`**
* `ecu_ev_throttle` MERGED WITH **`ecu_throttle`**
