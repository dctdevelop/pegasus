# 6.4.x - Release Notes
*Original release: Apr 27 - 2021*

### API

##### Added

* Added [new method](https://pegasus1.pegasusgateway.com/api-static/docs/#api-remote-SegmentSetup) for starting and stopping trips based on labels

```
{
    "method": "labels",
    "labels": "LABELSFORMAT"
}
```
where **LABELSFORMAT** has a format like this `"(?:(?:ss|se|ts|te|dd)=\w+;)+"` 
Where `ss = stop start`, `se = stop end`, `ts = trip start`, `te = trip end`, `dd = trip toggle` (toggles between start and end). 

Example: 

```
{
    "method": "labels",
    "labels": "ss=ignoff;ss=tripstp;dd=tripswtch;"
}
```

* Added io counters to vehicle's [/counters](https://pegasus1.pegasusgateway.com/api-static/docs/#api-Counters-GetCounters) API. These count the total time spent with each input/output activated.

##### Fixes

* Fixes a bug where the primary group would go to null when it was not passed on a PUT (update) of a vehicle

##### Improvements

* the key `network.iccid` and `gsm.sim.iccid` are now supported in the json receiver and used to save the sim card information for third party devices
