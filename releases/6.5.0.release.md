##### Fixes

- Fixed, if a vehicle with a single primary group had that group deleted the vehicle was deleted
- [Reversegeo API](http://docs.pegasusgateway.com/#reverse-geocoding), group geofences/zones are visible for site admins
- Fixed, mph calculation when receiver sent `position.speed` in kph

##### Changes

- Zones are defaulted to `false` on the [reversegeo API](https://pegasus1.pegasusgateway.com/api-static/docs/#api-ReverseGeo-GetReverseGeo), to return zones set the parameter to 1 or true

```
GET /api/reversegeo?lat=12.2345&lon=-80.5202&zones=1
```

- If an asset is deleted the API will not erase the peripherals associated
- A new user (deleted@pegasugateway.com) is assigned to triggers and geofences from deleted users

##### Improvements

- async rawdata requests were optimized
- Job manager capacity was increased to allow more simultaneous reports
- Proper handling of terminated jobs
- Proper HTTP responses when non-admin user with scope (geofences.admin:r) attempted to modify a geofence they weren't the owner of
