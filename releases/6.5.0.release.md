### API

##### Added

- New key `remote_delay` - from the [Interoperability Data Receiver](https://support.digitalcomtech.com/pegasus/admin-guide-en/#receiving-data-from-other-platforms) calculation from the time it takes the remote server to receive the event from a device, til the time Pegasus receives it
- New rawdata keys for virtual input/output counters

```
    counter_io_tamper
    counter_io_in1
    counter_io_in2
    counter_io_in3
    counter_io_out2
    counter_io_out1
    counter_io_exp_in1
    counter_io_exp_in2
    counter_io_exp_in3
    counter_io_exp_in4
    counter_io_exp_out1
    counter_io_exp_out2
    counter_io_exp_out3
    counter_io_exp_out4
    counter_io_exp_out1_short
    counter_io_exp_out2_short
    counter_io_exp_out3_short
    counter_io_exp_out4_short
```

- New keys for additional temperature sensors added (rawdata set: $temperature)

```
    temp1
    temp2
    temp3
    temp4
    temp5
    temp6
```

- New keys for ECU monitor for total voltage/amps etc.

```
    ecu_bms1_total_voltage
    ecu_bms1_total_amps
    ecu_bms1_soc
    ecu_bms1_positive_insulation_resistance
    ecu_bms1_negative_insulation_resistance
```

- New key added for the current transmission gear of the vehicle

```
    ecu_transmission_gear
```

##### Fixes

- Fixed, if a vehicle with a single primary group had that group deleted the vehicle was deleted
- [Reversegeo API](http://docs.pegasusgateway.com/#reverse-geocoding), group geofences/zones are visible for site admins

##### Changes

- Zones are defaulted to `false` on the [reversegeo API](https://pegasus1.pegasusgateway.com/api-static/docs/#api-ReverseGeo-GetReverseGeo), to return zones set the parameter to 1 or true

```
GET /api/reversegeo?lat=12.2345&lon=-80.5202&zones=1
```

- If an asset is deleted the API will not erase the peripherals associated
- A new user (deleted@pegasugateway.com) is assigned to triggers and geofences from deleted users

##### Improvements

- async rawdata requests were optimized
- Job manager capacity was increased to allow more simultaneous reports
- Proper handling of terminated jobs
- Proper HTTP responses when non-admin user with scope (geofences.admin:r) attempted to modify a geofence they weren't the owner of
