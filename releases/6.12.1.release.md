* Changed, field `ecu_parking_break` to `ecu_parking_brake`, [rawdata](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/389172/2s935vnLvt#a788e244-f0d5-41e8-930d-b2cd7f41ec5f)

### ⚠️ Important Vehicle Counter Change
* Changed, the vehicle counter fields need to be initialized with any value in order for the field to populate (vehicle_dev_dist, vehicle_dev_ign, etc. Note that this also applies to ECU counter values). More info on the counters affected can be found [here](https://pegasus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/counters#vehicle-counters).
* * Before this change the fields used to be auto-populated as soon as a device started reporting any of the device counters, now after this change the values need to be set manually by a user in order to populate the field, you can set them using a PUT on `/vehicles/:vid/counters` - [docs](https://pegasus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/counters#initializeupdate)
* * You can use the following logic depending on the use case you're looking for:

 use case | counter | api |
|:--------|---------|-----|
| delta for a time period (such as distance traveled, or ignition on time) | device counter (dev_dist, dev_ign) | `/counters` or `/rawdata`
| total value (odometer, hourmeter) | vehicle counter (vehicle_dev_dist, vehicle_dev_ign) | `/devices` api with the latest.vcounters values

* Please refer to the [counters docs](https://pegasus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/counters) for more information on the differences between the device and vehicle counters.
* Note that we added a general setting on the forwarder for enabling the filling of vehicle_counters with device an ecu counters
* * `"fill_vehicle_counters": true`

## Improvements

* Improved, unexpected counter values are better handled
* Improved, trigger logs lookup handles larger volumes
* Improved, reports server was added to handle loads during peak hours, deployment over next couple of weeks
