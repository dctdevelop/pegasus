##### Fixed

* Fixed, teltonika escort fuel sensor value mapping
* Fixed, syrus devices ignore XATT command when using a trip method != tracker

##### Improvements

* General improvements to the trips API when ECU data is present
* General improvements to the counters API when encountering devices with engine data and unforeseen values
* Improved topflytech devices battery levels
* Improvements to the json listener when receiving high amounts of data from third party devices (rt.platform devices now have optimized track points)
* Improved descriptions of trip keys in `/api/resources/trips/keys`

##### Changes

* The Lynx device labels are now [standard ones](https://pegasus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/device-interaction#-global-labels-list)
* The `mph` value in rawdata is now saved as a float (note that forwarders still send the value as an int unless you enable a new boolean option `__mph_float`)
* The fields `ecu_bms1_positive_insulation_resistance` & `ecu_bms1_negative_insulation_resistance` were deprecated, the following fields took their place: `ecu_positive_insulation_value` & `ecu_positive_insulation_value`
* The values for the fields `vehicle_ecu_eusage` and `vehicle_ecu_eidle` are being changed from centi-hours to seconds to be consistent with the [counters api](https://pegasus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/counters#introduction)
* The vehicle counter `ecu_dist` max limit was increased from 1e9-1 to 1e11-1 be set to (99,999,999,999)
* The live package payload was modified in the following ways
* * latest.data._fields_ `evid` and `trip_id` fields were removed
* * latest.data `_version` was added
* * the `latest.data.field.change.evtime` now reflects the time that the value changed, before it showed the last time it was at the previous value
* * added two new keys `prev_evtime`, `prev_systime` which depicts the time when the previous value was set
