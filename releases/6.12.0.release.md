* Added a new API resource under changelogs called [modifications](https://pegasus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/changelogs#modifications)
* Added new output management for topflytech devices
* Added accumulator & property conditions for triggers
* Added missing field `btt_driver_set` to rawdata
* Added 27 new [ECU fields](https://pegasus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/master-fields-list#accessory-ecu-monitor) that related to Scania p450

##### Fixed

* Fixed, teltonika escort fuel sensor value mapping
* Fixed, syrus devices ignore XATT command when using a trip method != tracker

##### Improvements

* General improvements to the trips API when ECU data is present
* General improvements to the counters API when encountering devices with engine data and unforeseen values
* New algorithm for detecting teltonika ignition values
* Improved topflytech devices battery levels
* Improvements to the json listener when receiving high amounts of data from third party devices (rt.platform devices now have optimized track points)

##### Changes

* The Lynx device labels are now [standard ones](https://pegasus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/device-interaction#-global-labels-list)
* The `mph` value in rawdata is now saved as a float (note that forwarders still send the value as an int)
* The keys `ecu_bms1_positive_insulation_resistance` & `ecu_bms1_negative_insulation_resistance` were deprecated, the following keys took their place: `ecu_positive_insulation_value` & `ecu_positive_insulation_value`
* The values for the fields `vehicle_ecu_eusage` and `vehicle_ecu_eidle` are being changed from centi-hours to seconds to be consistent with the [counters api](https://pegasus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/counters#introduction)
