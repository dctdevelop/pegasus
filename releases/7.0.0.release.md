# 7.0.0 - Release Notes
*Original release: 2023 FEB 28*
*Updated release: 2023 MAR 28*

## Additions
* Added, ability to retrieve videos using new [/event-media](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/389172/2s935vnLvt#4beb89f9-796f-49eb-801c-6d7b7d54f73a) API video capability
* Added, [linked asset replication](https://pegasus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/get-data#entities)
    * Vehicles that are linked to replicated assets - essentially push the same events that the device of the vehicle reports onto the asset, this allows the asset to have trips, rawdata, etc.
* Added, [segments](https://pegasus.digitalcomtech.com/docs) api
    * Similar to the trips api, this api creates an initial and final event based on certain criterias in order to get a summary over a span of time
* Added, support for [bluetooth sensor](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/389172/2s935vnLvt#aa7a8180-a2cd-477f-ae3a-cce4f7202255) tags from [Syrus 4](https://syrus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/bluetooth-accessories)
* Added new user scopes (subscopes are inherited by their parent scopes (vehicles and assets))
    * `vehicles.create` (subscope) - allow user to create vehicles
    * `vehicles.delete` (subscope) - allow user to delete vehicles
    * `vehicles:device` - allow user to associate a device to a vehicle
    * `assets.create` (subscope) - allow user to create assets
    * `assets.delete` (subscope) - allow user to delete assets
    * `geofences.path` (subscope) - allow user to edit the path of a geofence
* Added translations for labels in Czech (`cs` param..)

## Fixes
* [Trips api](https://pegasus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/segments#trips) was returning a `max_speed` value that would sometimes not be rounded correctly
* Fixed label assignment for gps backlog events XAKL

## Changes
* [Rawdata API](https://pegasus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/rawdata), field order is respected in HTML output
* [Assets linked](https://pegasus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/get-data#entity-linking--asset-replication) to a vehicle must share a group
    * Before any asset that was created could be associated to a group independent of what group that asset belonged to. After this change the asset and the vehicle must have at least 1 group in common in order for the asset linking to work.
* /event-photos API was deprecated, new API [/event-media](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/389172/2s935vnLvt#4beb89f9-796f-49eb-801c-6d7b7d54f73a)
    * The parameters are the same, but the URI path is now /event-media and can return both photo and video responses
* Live websockets now include an `outbox_size` with the total amount of commands in queue, only updates the payloads when there's < 10 commands in queue
    * Before every command would cause a new payload to be sent, now only when the value is < 10 it is updated, helps avoid too many messages while the device is (re)configured.
* [Trips API](https://pegasus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/segments#trips), ecu data from third party devices now feed the trips api, fields such as the total fuel consumed, distance traveled, and engine hours

## Improvements
* General improvements to fetches of platform API data (organization, tasks, triggers, geofences, etc.)
* Improvements to response time of devices API
